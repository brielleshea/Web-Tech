			 <p> <img src="Images/MyPicture.jpg" alt=" " title="A photo of myself" width="300"> I chose <a href="http://www.babson.edu"> Babson College </a> because I knew I wanted to study business, and I figured that going to an all business school with such good ratings will be useful in the future for my career. I found Babson by actually Googling business schools. Of course, Babson came up right away, but when I saw it I thought it was way too expensive and too much of a good school that I wouldn't even get into it.
			I eventually applied, and got in and obviously made the choice to come here. I enjoy that Babson is a small school in the suburbs, rather than a city.
			When I graduate, I hope to have a job in either the fashion world or in business analytics. I had an internship over the summer in fashion, and it was very fun and exciting. </p>

	<p> I enjoy baking desserts like brownies and flourless chocolate cake because I love anything that has chocolate in it. But I also do try to lead a <a href="http://healthy.net"> healthy </a> lifestyle
		so I eat a lot of organic and natural food. I also enjoy working out and lifting weights at the gym in addition to running.
