        <h1> Website Proposal </h1>
	<hr/>

	
	
	<p> My website will be about my mother, Robin Paden, and her specialized dating services. The website will contain information about 
the techniques she uses to match singles as well as her philosophy towards dating. The objective of the website will be to inform singles of 
her upcoming dating events. The goal for them is to introuduce them to a high caliber of people of the opposite sex, in hopes of finding them a potential soulmate. The events are held in venues such as fancy restaurants, and guests are handpicked by Robin herself.
Pricing and ticket information for each event will be listed, as well as give more information as to who the event is open to. The site will also serve as a way to educate singles as to why maybe they have not had much success using other
dating services such as match.com. The target audience are singles in the New Jersey/New York area who want to network
and meet other wealthy singles. Their demographics are aged 50-65, and they are in the middle upper class. </p>
	<p> The website will contain at least four pages of content. Some of this includes information about upcoming events in the NY/NJ area,
Robin's philosophy towards dating in which I will interview her, as well as show the other services she offers such as life coaching. I will put 
a link on the page that will direct the viewer to her life coaching website. There will also be a page that contains her monthly blog posts 
about how to be successful in love, career, etc. The whole website will be in third person, and is dedicated to promoting her services and educating the audience about dating. </p>
